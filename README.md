#CS50 AP Code Examples

##### Note: Executable files (files without a .c extensions) are included because these code examples line up with the CS50 AP curriculum, which is meant to be taught using the [CS50 IDE](cs50.io). Folders (or the entire repository) can be downloaded via the green `Clone or download` button on the top right, uploaded to the CS50 IDE (File -> Upload Local Files), and then unzipped on the command line (`unzip <folder>.zip`). Programs can then be run without re`make`ing.
